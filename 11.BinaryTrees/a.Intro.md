### Different Types of binary trees
- Full Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree
- Balanced Binary
- Degenerate Binary Tree

#### Full Binary Tree
- All the node should have 0 or 2 children

#### Complete BT
- All the levels are completely filled except the last level
- the last level has all nodes on left as possible

#### Perfect BT
- All the leaf nodes are at same level

#### Balanced BT
- A BST where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than 1. Height of tree at max log(N) (base 2)

#### Degenerate Tree
- Where all the node has only one child
