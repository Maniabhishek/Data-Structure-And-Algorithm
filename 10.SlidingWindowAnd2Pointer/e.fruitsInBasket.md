### Fruits In Basket
- given an array of type of fruits denoted by number , different number denotes different type, you are given k basket and , your task is to put those fruits in basket , each basket will be assigned one type of fruits , thus we need to find the maximum number of fruits we can store

> example : [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4] k = 2 , 2 basket are given , if take 1st 4 3,3,3,1 two type can't take 2 as it will be of different type, and can only be taken consecutive

> if you see , we can say we need to find the consecutive max subarray with max type = k

-  so the brute force approach will be simple explained in the below image:
