### Longest String Chain

- E.g., words: ["a","b", "ba", "bca", "bda", "bdca"] , string chain could be [a,ba, bca] [b, ba, bca] , here in this case the longest will be [a,ba, bca, bdca]
- so at every next element will have one extra character
- can we use lis solution here [lis](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/Data-Structure-And-Algorithm/blob/main/5.DynamicProgramming/e.LIS/b.longestIncresingSubsequence.md)
