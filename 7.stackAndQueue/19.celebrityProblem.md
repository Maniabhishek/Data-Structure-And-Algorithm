- you are given a matrix with 0 or 1 
- rows means celebrity , and a[i][j] means person i knows j 
- celebrity is the one who is known by everyone and knows no one

- TC: O(N*N) + O(N)
- SC: O(N+N)

```ts
function findCelebrity(arr: number[][]){
    const knowMe = new Array(arr.length).fill(0)
    const iknow = new Array(arr.length).fill(0)

    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++){
            if(arr[i][j] === 1){
                knowMe[j] += 1
                iknow[i] += 1 
            }
        }
    }
    let celebrity = -1
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if(iknow[i] === 0 && knowMe[i] === arr.length-1){
            celebrity = i
            break
        }
    }
    return celebrity
}

export function CallfindCelebrity(){
    const arr: number[][] = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
    console.log(findCelebrity(arr))
}
```
- let's try to optimize the code 
- minimum number of celebrity is 0, and max will be 1 
- there can never be more than 1 if 2 what does it mean if 1 is celebrity then it should be known by every one and know no one
- since 2 is also celebrity should be known by everyone but 1 knows no one , hence there is a conflict and cannot have more than one celebrity

- so the intuition here is eliminate the one who is not celebrity 
- how to do that , simply by finding who knows who , if one is not known by anyone then he is not a celebrity 
- so the intuition here is we place one pointer at 0th person and one last and we see if it knows each other or not 
- how to check it , if arr[top][down] is 1 then top know down, top is eliminated and vice versa

```ts
function getCelebrityOptimizedCode(arr: number[][]){
    let top = 0
    let down = arr.length-1
    while( top < down ){
        if(arr[top][down] === 1){
            top += 1
        }else if(arr[down][top] === 1) {
            down--
        }else {
            top++
            down--
        }
    }

    if(top > down ){
        return -1
    }

    let celebrity = top
    // for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    //     // rows check 
    //     if(arr[top][i] !== 0){
    //         celebrity = -1
    //         break
    //     }

    //     if(i !== top && arr[i][top] !== 1){
    //         celebrity = -1
    //         break
    //     }
    // }
    // optimised code 
    for(let i= 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if(i===top) continue
        if(arr[top][i] ===0  && arr[i][top] === 1) continue
        else {
            return -1
        }
    }
    return celebrity
}

export function CallfindCelebrity2(){
    const arr: number[][] = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
    console.log(getCelebrityOptimizedCode(arr))
}
```
