### Problem Statement: Given a circular integer array A, return the next greater element for every element in A. The next greater element for an element x is the first element greater than x that we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this element.


Example :
- Input: N = 11, A[] = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9}
- Output: 10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10
- Explanation: For the first element in A ,i.e, 3, the greater element which comes next to it while traversing and is closest to it is 10. Hence,10 is present on index 0 in the resultant array. Now for the second element,i.e, 10, there is no greater number and hence -1 is itâ€™s next greater element (NGE). Similarly, we got the NGEs for all other elements present in A.

- [14,1,7,3,5,8,9]
- task is to find the next greater element for each element 
- for 1 nge is 14, 14-> -1, ,2-> 3,...
- simplest approach is using brute force technique by using two for loops , but it will have TC:O(N^2) , SC:O(N)
- optimized solution could be traversing from the right side and using stack 
- conside the above given array when you are at 9 last index, stack is empty means no greater element on the right so simpy push -1
- psuh 9 to stack after moving to 8 check if stack has greater element 9 then nge for 8 is 9
- 5 -> 8
- 3-> 5
- 7 here we need to check if top element of stack is not greater then remove and keep checking for next greater
- popping , would it not cause any issue for element before this what if there is element just smaller than 3 , and is popped so answer is popping wont cause any issue 
- as any element which is smaller their next greater element will be current element i.e., 7 for example 1 you will not need 3,5 the popped element 
- consider it as pole , from the left all the smaller pole will be hidden behind bigger one

```ts
function NGE(arr: number[]){
    const stack = []
    const ngeArr = new Array(arr.length)
    for(let i = arr.length - 1; i >=0; i--){
        let nge = -1
        while(stack.length && arr[i] >= stack[stack.length - 1]){
            stack.pop()
        }

        if(stack.length != 0){
            nge = stack[stack.length-1]
        }
        ngeArr[i] = nge
        stack.push(arr[i])
    }
    console.log(ngeArr)
}

export function Call_NGE(){
    NGE([14,1,7,3,5,8,9])
}
```
